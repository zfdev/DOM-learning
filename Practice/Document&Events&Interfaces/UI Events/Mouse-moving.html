    <p>
        I close my eyes and I drift into the oneness.
        And I see you beside me. In this moment I freeze the time.
        I know that you are there, somewhere, feeling the same.
        I know you feel me.
        <strong>I open my eyes and I scared.</strong>
        of myself and my fear.
        I try to push you out of my mind.
        My heart is frozen like a winterstorm. Just let me be.
        I just want to push you away, why wouldn't you leave.
